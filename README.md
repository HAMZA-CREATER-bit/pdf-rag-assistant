RAG PDF Chatbot is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based assistant that lets you chat with your PDF documents. It uses LangChain, HuggingFace embeddings, FAISS for vector search, and DeepSeek LLM (but we can use any other LLM here) to answer your queries with accurate, context-aware responses.
